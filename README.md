My first go project 


I found a small server in the open spaces with one file.
I corrected minor inaccuracies and the server started working.
I divided individual functions into separate files and packages.
Created a Postgres database in a Docker container.
Converted functions to work with the database.


Everything was done solely for educational purposes.
